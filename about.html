  My journey into electrical engineering has not followed the traditional route. When I graduated high school I was not
  keen on attending a four year university. Instead I opted to enter the trades and study motorsports vehicle technology
  at Lanier Technical College. While at Lanier Tech, I immersed myself in the hands-on application of motorsports vehicle
  technology. I secured my first motorsports internship at a small Mazda Miata race team, OPM Autosports. There I learned
  about how the industry worked, and the logistical nightmare that it is to transport 14 cars to tracks across the east
  coast. After a year at OPM Autosports I found another internship with a higher-end race team, Denton Carden Racing
  (DCR). It was around this time that I graduated from Lanier Tech and began to work full time as a mechanic and
  trackside crew member. As I learned more about the motorsports industry, the more it became clear to me that I wanted
  to keep it as a personal hobby and not a full time job. To have a more fulfilling job and explore what I am really
  capable of, I decided to go back to school and earn an electrical engineering degree like my father. I enrolled at the
  University of North Georgia in the Spring of 2023. After four tough semesters of holding a part time job at DCR and
  working as a full time student, I was admitted into Georgia Tech. Now I commit all my time to the harder classes. With
  my free time I decided to join the GT crew and get to spend all my weekends rowing on the Chattahoochee River. In the
  future I plan to graduate and work for one year before returning to school for a master’s degree. I am interested in
  antenna design and want to find a career working in the telecommunications industry, especially satellite
  communications.
